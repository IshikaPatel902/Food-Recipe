our spices incredible. The aromas wafting out of regular home kitchens can compete with those from the fanciest fine-dining restaurants around the globe.
Our food is as rich as our food traditions. And just like our people, our food is diverse too. We have curries from the north and stews from the south.
We have egg-dal from Meghalaya and dal-baati from Rajasthan. There are fried snacks like samosas and steamed ones like khandvi. We have pickles made
from several types of vegetables and breads made with almost every grain and millet you could possibly think of. Every dish, every recipe tells a story of its 
own. From imbibing new cultures to adapting to new ingredients and making them your own, India's history and geographical position has a lot to do with the
incredible variety of dishes we enjoy.We as <b>Indians</b> are great foodie and very picky about our food taste, ingredients for the dish to turn out 
healthy.
 
As many of you would know, India was a part of many important trade routes in history. Travelers from far off seas would bring produce and spices known 
to them. Similarly, they would carry from here our local produce and introduce them to other places further along the trade route. Many food items we love 
were introduced to us this way. Here's a list of some of <mark>our favourites food with its recipes</mark> that were not locally available or produced to begin with.</i></pre>
